This MP should be use with any MCU with Dual Core, Freertos, >= 2MB PSRAM and atleast have 23 nor more GPIO pins, if planing to use this whole code as it, otherwise pins amount dont matter. Currently deveploping it on a ESP32-S3

Functions:
Reverse playback.
Realtime EQ.
Waveform visualizer.
UI(mostly done).
Display cover art.
Song selection.
Auto Update every bootup or manual
(adding more as this going)

Planing to add:
Bluetooth.

Limitation:
Audio only use .wav file, this is mainly for the reverse playback.
Art Cover only allow .bmp file, its just easier.
